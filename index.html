        <h3>Smoking:</h3>
        <p id="p1">
            Smoking is the practice of combustion and inhalation of tobacco and its history can be traced back to 5000
            BC. While in recent decade its popularity has come to an apex due to the rise in living standard of people
            tobacco had become much affordable. But, is smoking a positive feature? The answer is absolutely negative.
            Tobacco kills more than 8 million people each year. More than 7 millions of those deaths are the result of
            direct tobacco use while around 1.2 million are the result of non-smokers being exposed to second-hand
            smoke.

            With over 60 percent of Pakistanis being under 30 years of age, every day 1,200 children are getting
            addicted to smoking, just because cigarettes are handy and cheap enough for them to have. While smoking
            could be very harmful to the health and hygiene of youths, Adolescent years are times of important brain
            development. Brain development begins during the growth of the fetus in the womb and continues through
            childhood and to about age 25. Nicotine exposure during adolescence and young adulthood can cause addiction
            and harm the developing brain. Smoking causes cancer, heart disease, stroke, lung diseases, diabetes, and
            chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) <a

            cause death. In Pakistan the rising prevalence of tobacco among youths is unignorable with male youths to be
            the most outstanding smoker this issue needs to be focused.
