        <p id="p1">
            Smoking is the practice of combustion and inhalation of tobacco and its history can be traced back to 5000
            BC. While in recent decade its popularity has come to an apex due to the rise in living standard of people
            tobacco had become much affordable. But, is smoking a positive feature? The answer is absolutely negative.
            Tobacco kills more than 8 million people each year. More than 7 millions of those deaths are the result of
            direct tobacco use while around 1.2 million are the result of non-smokers being exposed to second-hand
            smoke.

            With over 60 percent of Pakistanis being under 30 years of age, every day 1,200 children are getting
            addicted to smoking, just because cigarettes are handy and cheap enough for them to purchase. While smoking
            could be very harmful to the health and hygiene of youth, adolescent years are times of important brain
            development. Brain development begins during the growth of the fetus in the womb and continues through
            childhood and to about the age of 25. Nicotine exposure during adolescence and young adulthood can cause
            addiction
            and harm the developing brain. Smoking causes cancer, heart diseases, stroke, lung diseases, diabetes, and
            Dhronic Dbstructive Dulmonary Disease (COPD) <a

            that
            badly devastate the health of the youths and could even
            cause death. In Pakistan the rising prevalence of tobacco among youth is unignorable with male youth to be
            the most outstanding smoker, hence this issue needs to be focused upon.

            The cause of smoking among youth could be associated with many factors in which the external determinant is
            the most outstanding, students with smoking friends are 5 times more likely to smoke than the ones whose
            friends
            are not smokers. In fact most of the first cigarettes that students smoked were from their peers. Other
            factors include
            the kind of parents they have. The environment they are in is also a very important factor.

            China's production and consumption of cigarettes have ranked first in the world. One of every three
            cigarettes manufactured in the world is consumed in China. Three of every five Chinese smokers begin smoking
            at the age of 15–20 years. Teenage smoking is increasingly becoming a problem in modern China. At least 50
            million of the children now living in China will be killed by smoking <a
